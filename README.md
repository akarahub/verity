NER Analysis

This script implements a pipeline for training a token classification model for named entity recognition (NER) on a custom dataset. The process includes data loading, preprocessing (tokenization and label alignment), metric calculation, and model training using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The pipeline is designed to be modular and robust, employing logging for debugging and configuration through a YAML file. It leverages techniques such as word-level tokenization and label alignment to handle multi-word entity names effectively. The code prioritizes readability and maintainability through clear function definitions and comments.
